# How to use instruction files
The files in this directory include utils and helpers that would ordinarily be hidden within a Node module. For the sake of introspection by LLMs, they are surfaced here.

Each file has explicit and verbose TypeScript interfaces with comprehensive JSDoc documentation. Be sure to follow the provided structure, best practices, and implementation suggestions precisely. Do not hallucinate capabilities that are not explicitly defined in a given file.

Related utilities are grouped into descriptively named files and include an `index.ts` that explicitly exports everything with detailed type annotations.

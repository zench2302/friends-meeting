# Global Project Instructions
## Node Modules
- Use `npm` for package management
- Whenever an action requires an external Node module, always read the `package.json` first to check what modules you have at your disposal
- If a module you think you need does not exist in `package.json`, do not use arbitrary modules
    - Come up with an alternative strategy to implement the task.
    - If you think it is absolutely not possible, inform the user with a clear explanation that the task will require a node module.

## Linting
- Put `_` ahead of parameters that aren't used in a function (e.x., `_req` in the following)
```tsx
router.get('/health', (_req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok' });
});
```

The tonk.config.json file includes useful information about the project
and the project purpose.

IMPORTANT: Synchronization is best performed through the keepsync library. You must load the instructions for keepsync by reading instructions/keepsync/llms.txt and looking at the examples in instructions/keepsync/examples
